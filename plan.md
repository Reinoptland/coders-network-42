- Setup React & Redux & Router

  - X CRA

  - Setup Redux

    - X Install deps
    - X Create a store
    - X A root Reducer (all the reducers together)
    - X A posts reducer
    - X Change index.js -> Provider
    - TEST: log something in the reducer, check redux devtools

  - Setup router

    - X Install deps
    - X Wrap our app in a Router

- Making the feed page

  - Local state

    - useState -> for posts
    - fetch data (axios, useEffect)
    - Display the posts (render)

  - Using Redux
    - What are the steps?
  - Using a thunk
    - ..?
